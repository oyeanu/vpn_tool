## Introduction

This repository aims to provide a centralized collection of resources, configurations, and scripts to enhance your experience with the Loon app. Whether you're looking for pre-configured setups, custom rules, or advanced usage guides, you'll find valuable resources here.

## Warehouse Selection

### For China Telecom and China Unicom Users

- Select content from the [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/lodepuly/vpn_tool) and add `gitlab.com` as a direct connection.
- Avoid using a proxy to download files from the [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/lodepuly/vpn_tool), as it may trigger human-machine verification and cause download failures.

### For Mobile Network Users

- Mobile users in most areas may have difficulty accessing `gitlab.com` directly.
- It is recommended to choose the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/luestr/ProxyResource) and access it through a proxy.
